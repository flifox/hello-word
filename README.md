# Introduction:  

We all are familiar with Jarvis' AI assistant robot from â€œIron Man'' movies and Marvel series. It has always been a dream of programmers to make something on their own. Then I tried to make my own smart computer program using Python and Arduino programming. that understands human natural languages through voice commands or text and performs tasks for the user. 

  

Why did I name the robot FlyFox ? Because it's my personal nickname! 

  

I invited my grandma, an uneducated person, to try my program to use the computer. she was reluctant at first but as soon as she said "send a message to Aicha" and the computer opened WhatsApp web and automatically sent the message, then, she had a huge smile on her face. He looked at me and said "I have never used a computer in my life, until now and I am thankful to you."  

Those words really hit me. 

  

# Features: 

The current features of the program are:  

- control appliances 

- recognize English language 

- gives back witty replies 

- control the computer functions 

- Performing Google search  

- opening some popular websites (like Google, YouTube, Stack overflow) 

- calculator 

- send emails/ WhatsApp messages 

  

# Project Details: 

I used Visual Code as IDE, and Python and Arduino as programming language, first step I install and import all the necessary libraries, then I wrote a python and Arduino Scripts. 

With FlyFox it would easier to send messages without typing a single word, searching on Wikipedia without actually opening the web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks with the help of a single voice command. 



  

# My Goal:  

  

My goal is to make the Program a complete A.I. that can also understand Natural Language and has Machine Language too then integrate this application into your phone or tablet as well. I have many ideas but I am limited by my knowledge. 

  

I hope to join college next year and learn about these concepts in college and then implement these concepts in my program!
